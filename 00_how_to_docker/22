# 22. Turn Aiur into a slave of the local swarm in which Char is leader 
# (the command to take control of Aiur is not requested).

docker-machine ssh Aiur "docker swarm join --token $(docker swarm join-token -q worker) $(docker-machine ip Char):2377"

# docker node ls // List nodes in the swarm

# docker swarm join-token -q worker // gives token for current machine as a worker (-q means quite mod, token only)
