# overlay: Overlay networks connect multiple Docker daemons together and enable swarm services 
# to communicate with each other. You can also use overlay networks to facilitate communication 
# between a swarm service and a standalone container, or between two standalone containers 
# on different Docker daemons. This strategy removes the need to do OS-level routing between 
# these containers. See overlay networks.
