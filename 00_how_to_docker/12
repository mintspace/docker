# 12. Launch a mysql container as a background task. It should be able to restart on its own in 
# case of error, and the root password of the database should be Kerrigan. You will also make 
# sure that the database is stored in the hatchery volume, that the container directly creates 
# a database named zerglings, and that the container itself is named spawning-pool.

docker run -d --restart on-failure --name spawning-pool -v hatchery:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Kerrigan
-e MYSQL_DATABASE=zerglings mysql --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password

# -e --env set env
# /var/lib/mysql - sql dir
# -v --volume allows data from container to be saved in created volume
